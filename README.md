# SmartRetail Supplier Sync - Event-Driven Inventory Coordination

## Overview

This project implements an event-driven inventory coordination system for SmartRetail using Azure services. It demonstrates how backend services emit stock events to an Azure Storage Queue, which triggers an Azure Function to process events and notify a Supplier API microservice for restocking.

---


- **Backend Service**: Publishes stock events to Azure Storage Queue.
- **Azure Storage Queue**: Acts as the message broker for stock events.
- **Azure Function**: Triggered by queue messages, calls Supplier API.
- **Supplier API**: Receives restock requests and logs the events.

---

## Event Type Chosen and Why

- **Azure Storage Queue** was selected for event messaging due to its simplicity, reliability, and native integration with Azure Functions.
- Azure Storage Queues provide a cost-effective way to decouple components and implement asynchronous communication.
- The system simulates real-world inventory management with events triggering supplier restock actions.

---

## Message Format and Flow

- Messages are JSON objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "productId": "SKU-123",
  "quantity": 2,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T19:00:00Z",
  "correlationId": "uuid-generated-id"
}
````

* **Flow**:

  1. Backend checks inventory and emits a stock event if below threshold.
  2. Message is sent to Azure Storage Queue (`stock-events`).
  3. Azure Function listens for new queue messages.
  4. Function parses the message and calls Supplier API with product details and correlation ID.
  5. Supplier API processes the restock request and logs the event.

---

## Instructions to Deploy and Test

### Prerequisites

* Azure subscription with Storage Account and Function App.
* Python 3.11+ and Azure Functions Core Tools installed.
* Docker installed (optional for local containerized testing).

### Deployment Steps

1. **Set up Azure Storage Queue**:

   * Create a Storage Account and Queue named `stock-events`.

2. **Deploy Supplier API**:

   * Run locally or containerize using Docker.
   * Start API on `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Configure Azure Function**:

   * Update `local.settings.json` with connection string and `SUPPLIER_API_URL`.
   * Deploy function using Azure Functions Core Tools or Azure Portal.

4. **Run Backend Service**:

   * Execute `emit_stock_event.py` locally to emit test stock events.

5. **Trigger and Monitor**:

   * Azure Function will trigger automatically on queue messages.
   * Check logs on Backend, Azure Function, and Supplier API for correlation ID tracing.

## Logs Demonstrating Correlation ID Traceability

* Backend log sample:

```
[Backend] Emitted event for SKU-123 (Qty: 2) | correlationId: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

* Azure Function log sample:

```
INFO: Received message: {"productId":"SKU-123","quantity":2,"correlationId":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"}
INFO: Successfully called supplier API: {"message":"Restock received for product SKU-123"}
```

* Supplier API log sample:

```
[Supplier API] Restock received for product SKU-123, quantity 2, correlationId 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

* Log Analytics query shows full end-to-end trace via correlation ID.
